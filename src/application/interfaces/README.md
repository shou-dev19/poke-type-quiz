# Application Interfaces

This directory contains application service interfaces for the Pokemon Type Quiz application.

## Interfaces to be implemented:

- **IQuizService.ts** - High-level quiz management interface
- **IGameController.ts** - Game flow control interface
- **IUIStateManager.ts** - UI state management interface (future)

Each interface should:
- Define application-level contracts
- Bridge domain and presentation layers
- Support multiple presentation implementations
- Include proper error handling definitions
