# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Pokemon type compatibility quiz application project. Currently, the repository is in the initial planning phase with only documentation files.

## Development Workflow

This project follows a structured AI-driven development approach:

1. **Requirements Definition** (`docs/requirements.md`) - Define what to build, including features and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** (`design.md`) - Define how to build it, including technical architecture, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and data models  
3. **Task Planning** (`tasks.md`) - Break down implementation into concrete, step-by-step tasks for systematic development

## Current State

The repository contains only documentation:
- `README.md` - Project overview and development methodology (in Japanese)
- `docs/requirements.md` - Requirements definition file (currently minimal)

## Next Steps for Development

When implementing this project, follow the established workflow:
1. Complete the requirements definition in `docs/requirements.md`
2. Create `design.md` with technical architecture and system design
3. Create `tasks.md` with detailed implementation plan
4. Begin implementation following the task list

## Project Language

Documentation is primarily in Japanese, indicating this is likely a Japanese-language project.
